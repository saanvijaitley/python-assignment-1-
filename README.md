# python-assignment-1-
This project contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic input handling, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations — foundational skills for any beginner learning Python.
	•	Task 1: Performs basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers entered by the user.
	•	Task 2: Generates a personalized greeting message by taking the user’s first and last names as input, combining them into a full name, and displaying a friendly message.

These tasks help strengthen your understanding of:
	•	Python input and output functions (input(), print())
	•	Type conversion
	•	String concatenation
	•	Basic arithmetic operators

## Features
	•	User friendly interactive input
	•	Handles basic arithmetic in real time
	•	Clean and readable code structure
	•	Encourages beginner level practice in Python fundamentals

# How to Run
	1.	Make sure you have Python is installed on your system.
	2.	Clone or download this repository.
	3.	Open a terminal PyCharm.
	4.	Run the script
